<h2>Profile Sync</h2>
<p>Profile Sync allows you to synchronize mod configurations across multiple Mod Organizer 2 profiles, keeping them in sync automatically or creating profile groups with different mod loadouts.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sync Groups:</b> Create groups of profiles that stay synchronized</li>
    <li><b>State Groups:</b> Define different states within a group for varied configurations</li>
    <li><b>Automatic Sync:</b> Changes propagate automatically when mods are installed, removed, enabled, disabled, or reordered</li>
    <li><b>Category Control:</b> Choose which mod categories to sync for each state</li>
</ul>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<h4>Sync Groups</h4>
<p>A sync group is a collection of profiles that share the same mod configuration. When you make changes to one profile in a sync group, those changes are automatically applied to all other profiles in the group.</p>

<h4>State Groups</h4>
<p>State groups allow you to create different configurations within a sync group. Each state can include different profiles and mod categories, giving you fine-grained control over what gets synchronized.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h4>Creating a Sync Group</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Open the Profile Sync dialog from the Tools menu</li>
    <li>In the Sync Groups tab, click to add a new group</li>
    <li>Select which profiles should be part of this group</li>
    <li>Changes made in any profile will now sync to others in the group</li>
</ol>

<h4>Creating State Groups</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Switch to the State Groups tab</li>
    <li>Add a new state group</li>
    <li>Select which profiles belong to this state</li>
    <li>Choose which mod categories should be synchronized for this state</li>
</ol>

<h4>Managing Groups</h4>
<p>Use the interface to add, remove, and modify sync groups and state groups. You can have multiple groups with different configurations to suit various modding scenarios.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>The last change made is not synchronizing to other profiles.</h4>
<p>Profile Sync runs on specific events: when a mod is installed, removed, enabled/disabled, or reordered through drag and drop. If another action causes a change, it may not trigger a sync.</p>
<p>To force a sync, toggle the enabled state of any mod back and forth once.</p>

<h4>Sync is slow or causes lag.</h4>
<p>Profile Sync can use threaded operations for better performance. Check the plugin settings for async options.</p>

<h4>Some mods are not syncing.</h4>
<p>Verify that the mod's category is included in your state group configuration. Only categories selected for a state will be synchronized.</p>
