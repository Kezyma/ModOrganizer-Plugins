<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Quick Installers:</b> Save mod installers for easy re-running</li>
    <li><b>No Re-download:</b> Re-install mods without downloading again</li>
    <li><b>Multiple Versions:</b> Keep different versions of the same mod installer</li>
    <li><b>FOMOD Support:</b> Re-run FOMOD installers to change options</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing Installers</h4>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Create installers for mods with complex FOMOD options that you might want to change later</li>
    <li>Keep installers for mods you frequently reinstall or update</li>
    <li>The installer uses the original downloaded archive, so don't delete it from your downloads folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>Installer not running.</h4>
<p>Ensure the original download file still exists in your Mod Organizer downloads folder. If the file has been deleted, you'll need to re-download the mod.</p>

<h4>Wrong version installing.</h4>
<p>Check the version dropdown to ensure you have the correct version selected before clicking Install.</p>

<h4>Mod not appearing in download list.</h4>
<p>Only mods in your Mod Organizer downloads folder will appear. Ensure the mod has been downloaded through Mod Organizer.</p>
